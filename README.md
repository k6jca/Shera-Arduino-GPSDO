# Shera-Arduino-GPSDO

This repository contains Mathworks Simulink models for simulating the Brooks Shera GPSDO algorithm on my Arduino platform and for comparing this Arduino/Shera simulation against my original Brooks Shera GPSDO simulation.

It also contains my Arduino code implementing this same algorithm.
